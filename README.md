I am a Software Engineer. I live in San Francisco, California.

Until recently, I was the Founder and CTO at [Last9](https://last9.io).
I conceptualized and built [Levitate](https://www.linkedin.com/products/last9-levitate-a-managed-time-series-warehouse/).

Previously, I have built and exited [Oogway](https://oogway.in), Datascale, and [Siminars](https://siminars.com)

Outside of Software, I am a trained long-distance runner.
